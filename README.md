# BrickBreaker
BrickBreak Java Game with High Scores using Filing 

Future-> This is a Java-based BrickBreak game with high scores functionality using file I/O. The game is a classic arcade-style game in which players break bricks using a ball and paddle. The objective of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen without letting the ball fall off the bottom of the screen.

This game includes features such as power-ups, different levels, and a high score system. The high score system is implemented using file I/O, which means that the scores are saved to a file and can be retrieved even after the game is closed. This allows players to compete with each other for the highest score.

The game is built using Java Swing and AWT libraries, making it easy to run on any platform that supports Java. The code is well-structured, making it easy to modify and extend the game as needed.

This project is a great example for beginner to intermediate Java programmers who want to learn game development with file I/O functionality.
